This repository contains an analysis of survey data, including:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median)
- Compensation analysis (`ConvertedCompYearly`) by country
- Distribution of education levels among respondents
- Relationships between education level and compensation

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to View or Run

- **View on GitHub:**  
You can open the Jupyter Notebook directly on GitHub to see the code, tables, and visualizations without installing anything. Simply navigate to `notebooks/survey_analysis.ipynb` in the repository.

- **Run Locally (Optional):**  
If you want to run the notebook on your own computer, you need Jupiter Notebook and the required libraries installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

## Key Findings
- Among respondents who program in Python, mean and median compensation varies by country.
- The top 5 respondents with the highest compensation have education levels of Bachelorâ€™s degree (2) and Doctorate (3).
